						<h1>FRC#8 Paly Robotics</h1>
						<p>Aug 2016-June 2020</p>
						<p class="major"> Robotics has been the most exciting adventure and team experience of my life. It was an environment where everyone around me was highly skilled, compassionate, and most importantly motivated to achieve our common goal of building the best robot possible. In a team like that, there is nothing I felt we couldn’t achieve.</p>
						<p class="major">It was here I learned almost all of my machining, manufacturing, rapid prototyping, and design knowledge — by doing, failing, and trying again.</p>

							<p>My senior year of highschool I had the privilege of being the Team Captain of my robotics team where I helped lead our team to our first competition win in 14 years. We compete in FIRST Robotics Competition, a rigorous and competitive robotics league where thousands of high school teams around the world strategize, prototype, design, build, and program a robot from scratch in just 8 weeks.</p>

							<p>In previous years, we had always come up short and never achieved our goal of winning a competition. As Team Captain there was nothing I wanted more than to finally see all our thousands of hours of preparation, research, planning, and teaching as a team come to fruition — to achieve what we been building towards but never quite been able to reached these last few years. Our team is structured into a build, design, software, business, and art team. My primary responsibility was to project manage between all these subteams and make the overarching machinery of our team work. I learned that it is impossible to be successful if every subteam just focuses on their own work with their heads down so it was my job to coordinate the big picture for completing the robot.</p>

							<h2>Our 2020 Robot: Nari</h2>
							<p>Our 2020 robot is named Nari. The objective of this year's game was to score yellow foam dodgeballs into different goals and climb a swinging bar at the end of the match. There were countless highs and lows throughout this journey which will be glossed over but I hope to highlight some of the more significant mechanisms and design challenges when completing Nari.</p>

							<h3>Shooter</h3>
							<p>For this year's game we needed to shoot dodgeballs into goals. To be competitive, we needed the shooter to be consistent and be able to unload many balls at once — what we referred to as a “stream” of balls. Since we had never made a flywheel shooter before, the prototyping phase helped us find out optimal wheel size and compression ratio to shoot the ball as far as possible.</p>

					<section class="spotlight style1 orient-right content-align-left image-position-center onscroll-image-fade-in">
						<div class="content">
							<p>As a result of our testing our shooter ended up being one of the most consistent and powerful at the competition. It also features an adjustable hood with two positions for shooting from far away or close up. The shooter was one of the most reliable mechanisms of our robot.</p>

						<div class="content">
							<h3>Indexer</h3>
							<p>The indexer is responsible for sorting the balls and feeding them into our shooter. This was the mechanism that gave us the most trouble — dodgeballs are surprisingly soft and sticky. At first we used a “beavertail” style of criss-crossing belts to funnel the balls into the center but this led to jams.</p>

					<section class="spotlight style1 orient-right content-align-left image-position-center onscroll-image-fade-in">
						<div class="large_content">
							<p>Next we tried using a funnel and v-oriented of belts to channel the balls into the center shoot. To eliminate jams, we programmed one side of the belts to spin faster than the other. After a lot of turning this design proved to be effective.</p>

						<div class="content">
							<h3>Intake</h3>
							<p>The intake arm is incharge of accumulating balls into the robot. We wanted to follow a “touch it own it” philosophy where as soon as we touch a ball, it is instantly in our control — no need for slow alignment.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="image">

						</div>
					</section>

					<section class="spotlight style1 orient-right content-align-left image-position-center onscroll-image-fade-in">
						<div class="content">
							<p>To achieve this we made the intake as wide as possible to be able to intake multiple balls at once. Since matches are chaotic, we also wanted the arm to be able to withstand collisions with other robots so we designed it with a virtual four bar that can compresse inwards when hit.</p>
