						<h1>Semi-Auto Eboard</h1>
						<p>April 2021 - Present</p>
						<p class="major">It was an unusually hot, humid spring day. I was walking to class carrying my heavy backpack over my sweat drenched back when I thought of a way I could both carry my stuff and get to class quicker. My idea was to make an electric longboard with a person-following mode: a semi-autonomous longboard. When I am not riding, it could follow me around carrying my stuff. This project piqued my interest because of its mechanical and software duality — a perfect way for me to develop my experience with robotic systems. At the time of writing, this project is not yet done but is considerably far along since most of the theoretical design has been completed.</p>

							<h2>Steering Module Design</h2>
							<p>The steering module consists of a main steering tube that is housed in an aluminum cage. This cage was designed to be as flat and compact as possible while still being able to take all the harsh loads of riding.</p>

							<p>The center shaft has a welded boss which interfaces with a 3D printed pulley that steers and rotates the whole shaft. Since there are so many features required of this center shaft, designing all the welded parts to be manufacturable and weldable was challenging and involved strategically placed chamfers and undercuts.</p>

							<p>The most challenging part of this design was coming up with a mechanism that could lock the steering module from turning when I want to ride the board normally and unlock when I want it to follow me around. Backlash in the locking mechanism also needed to be mitigated since that would make it unstable to ride. After exploring many different locking mechanisms, I decided to create my own simple pin and hole clutch. The steering module will have a tapered hole and the clutch plate would have a matching tapered pin that would fit into the hole. The taper is to prevent backlash.</p>

							<h2>Mechanical Challenges</h2>
							<p>Making a longboard robotically steerable proved more challenging than intuitively expected. Since the longboard must also autonomously carry a payload, I could not make the entire board lean to steer. Instead I decided to put the entire powertrain on a rotating turret. Now the challenge was making this module as compact as possible while still being able to withstand the dynamic loads of riding, leaning, and going over bumps at high speeds.</p>

							<p> These requirements meant a lot of hand calculations to spec bearings, shafts, and pins. To calculate the impact force on the module while going over a bump, I used Matlab to solve a spring damper system I modeled after the board. To double check, I also used the dynamics simulator ADAMS to simulate a simplified model of the board going over a bump.</p>
							<p>At the time of writing this, the steering module is nearing the end of its first design cycle and I am preparing to manufacture the parts.</p>

							<h2>Software Challenges</h2>
							<p>For my tracking requirements, I wanted the board to be able to work indoors and outdoors, follow me through tight turns, and keep close to me if I was walking through crowded areas. Through my research, I was immediately daunted by how difficult it would be to make a robust computer vision system that could track me through multiple environments and be able to recover from interruptions in case I was blocked from view. It was just going to be too laborious.</p>
							<p>The next best option for me was to have my board follow some sort of a beacon using GPS, W-Fi, or Bluetooth but these signal technologies are all too coarse for precise distance measurements. Around this time, Apple had just released AirTags which is an indoor tracking beacon and it worked exactly how I imagined my longboard would work — real time, precise positioning down to a few centimeters.</p>
							<p>I found out that AirTags use ultra wideband which, unlike Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, relies on time of flight instead of signal strength to calculate distance between transmitter and receiver. The only issue is that the technology is not as widespread and thus more expensive to implement. At the time of writing I have specced the ultra wideband transceiver but the rest of the software and controls for this project are still being researched.</p>
