						<h1>Semi-Auto Eboard</h1>
						<p>April 2021 - Present</p>
						<p class="major">It was an unusually hot, humid spring day. I was trudging home after a long day of lectures when I thought of an interesting solution to my last-mile transportation predicament. What if I had an electric skateboard that could also carry my stuff?</p>
						<p class="major">My idea was to make an electric longboard with a person-following mode: a semi-autonomous longboard. This way I would not have to carry it and it could also carry my stuff. This project piqued my interest because of its mechanical and software duality. At the time of writing, I have simulated, designed, and manufactured all mechanical components of the Semi-Auto Eboard. I am currently implementing the tracking feature using ultra-wide band ranging.</p>

							<h2>Mechanical Challenges</h2>
							<p>Making a longboard robotically steerable proved more challenging than expected. I needed a mechanism that could both robotically steer the longboard, but also robust enough for me to ride the longboard normally.</p>

							<p>My solution was to put the entire truck on a rotating turret with a clutch to lock it in place. Designing the module to be compact and able withstand the dynamic loads of riding, leaning, and going over bumps at high speeds was very challenging.</p>

							<p>From personal experience, I decided that riding over a large crack in the road would be my worst case impact scenario. To calculate the impact loads, I wrote a lagrangian mechanics python simulation from scratch. To double check, I also made a simulation using the dynamics simulator ADAMS to simulate a simplified model of the board going over a bump.</p>

							<h2>Steering Module Design</h2>
							<p>The steering module consists of a main steering tube that is housed in an aluminum cage. This cage was designed to be as flat and compact as possible while still being able to take all the harsh loads of riding.</p>

						<div class="content">
							<p>The most challenging part of this design was coming up with a mechanism that could lock the steering module from turning when I want to ride the board normally and unlock when I want it to follow me around. After exploring many different locking mechanisms, I decided to create my own simple pin and hole clutch.</p>

							<p>The head tube has a locking arm with a tapered hole. The clutch plate has a corresponding tapered pin that mates with the tapered hole. Since the clutch plate is always spring loaded to compress into the hole, most of the backlash from the pin and hole interface is eliminated.</p>

							<p>A servo arm pulls on two cables which pulls the clutch plate upwards. The cables are routed through two black cable housings in the top.</p>
							<p>The steering motor is a 90-deg drive motor with a built-in encoder. It is coupled to the center shaft using timing belts and pulleys.</p>

							<h2>Controls (ongoing)</h2>
							<p>I want the board to follow me me indoors and outdoors, through tight turns, and through crowded areas. To do this, I decided to go with beacon tracking with ultra-wide band ranging modules because of their robustness in multiple environments, high precision, and relative simplicity.</p>
							<p>Thus far, I have successfully implemented a “remote control” mode for my longboard. I designed a custom remote with a two-pot joystick where a long press can toggle between “riding mode” and “RC mode”. When in “RC mode” the servo lifts the clutch plate and a position feedback loop is used to turn the steering motor.</p>
							<p>At the time of writing, I have started experimenting with ultra-wide band modules and have begun implementing the tracking features.</p>

							<h2>Electronics</h2>
							<p>For this project I built my own 12s2p 18650 battery pack from scratch. I chose to make my own pack because it was hard to find a battery with a flat profile that still had a large enough capacity for my liking. The pack is spot welded using nick strips and has an off-the-shelf BMS.</p>

							<p>I am using a Dual Fesc 6.6 Mini. This is based on the open-source VESC designs which has built-in encoder support and data logging. 
							<p>To control the steering motor, I am using a cheap L298N motor driver.</p>
							<p>For my microcontroller, I am using an ESP32 Feather. The ESP32 Feather has multiple ADC channels, multiple PWM channels, and eight timers. This made it possible to drive servos, run feedback loops, and manage encoder inputs simultaneously.</p>
